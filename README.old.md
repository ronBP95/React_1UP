# 1UP

1UP is a productivity app that aims to "gamify" your life. You can create todo's, look at your statistics and reward yourself either by getting enough credits through doing tasks or by leveling up.

Each task can have an amount (as some tasks have more impact on your life than others) and you can set rewards for yourself like eating some food or watching television for 30 minutes after finishing your tasks. 

There will be two views:
Non-Auth: Can only see tutorials on how the application works
Auth: Can view your dashboard and have full functionality of the app. 

Update:
For the moment, the auth is not working as intended. The productivity view that allows you to create tasks and spend your balance on rewards is available for all users.
